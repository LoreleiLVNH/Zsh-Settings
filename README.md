# Zsh Settings
My personal configuration for _Zsh_
## Setup
Run the following command on the terminal:
- via curl:
```shell
sh -c "$(curl -pfsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LoreleiPenn/Zsh-Settings/master/zsh-setup.sh)"
```
- via wget:
```shell
sh -c "$(wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LoreleiPenn/Zsh-Settings/master/zsh-setup.sh)"
```
This will setup _Oh my zsh_ which is necessary for my settings and using the plugins defined on the _zshrc_ file.

To change the shell, the command
```shell
chsh -s /bin/zsh USERNAME
```
is executed.
